Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000
xi. user table = 10,000
	
--Finding the total number of records for each table	
Select (Select Count(*) From Attribute) As Total_Records_Att
       ,(Select Count(*) From Business) As Total_Records_Bus
       ,(Select Count(*) From Category) As Total_Records_Cate
       ,(Select Count(*) From Checkin) As Total_Records_Check

       ,(Select Count(*) From Tip) As Total_Records_Tip
       ,(Select Count(*) From "User") As Total_Records_User

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10,000
ii. Hours = 1,562
iii. Category = 2,643
iv. Attribute = 1,115
v. Review = 10,000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10,000
viii. Tip = 3,979
ix. User = 10,000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
Select  "Name"
        ,Review_count
From "User"
Order by Review_count Desc
Limit 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

-- Unable to do the square root so I solved for r^2 instead. 
Select (Count(*) * Sum(review_count*fans) - Sum(review_count)*Sum(fans)) 
    * (Count(*) * Sum(review_count*fans) - Sum(review_count)*Sum(fans))
    / ((Count(*) * Sum(review_count*review_count) - Sum(review_count)*Sum(review_count))
     * (Count(*) * Sum(fans*fans) - Sum(fans)*Sum(fans))) As "R^2"
 From "User"

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
The results are on the table below. A r^2 of approximently .44 shows that review_count does explain a certain amount of 
the variable fans. If we were to take a square root of the r^2 it will give us around .66 which shows a positive correlation between the two variables. 
+----------------+
|            R^2 |
+----------------+
| 0.437136492915 |
+----------------+

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

My picks only had businesses with 4 or 5 stars so I will analyze those groups instead of 2-3 and 4-5
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

 No the two groups seem to have very similar hours. 

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes, the group with the 4 star ratings had a greater number of reviews on average than the group with a 5 star rating.        
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

SQL code used for analysis:
Select  b.name
        ,b.city
        ,c.category
        ,h.hours
        ,b.stars
From business b inner join category c on b.id = c.business_id
        inner join "hours" h on b.id = h.business_id 
Where city = 'Las Vegas' And category = 'Health & Medical'
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

   A diffence that we sww is that the businesses that are still open have more reviews on average.      
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
   Another difference is the star rating, businesses that are still open have a higher star rating on average than those that are closed.   
         
SQL code used for analysis:

Select Is_open, Avg(Stars), Avg(Review_count)
From Business
Group by Is_open
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
Being able to predict the star rating on business based on keywords from the review (NLP)
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

The data I will need is the names of the businesses that we are conducting the analysis on. I would need the written reviews and their corresponding star ratings.

I need this data to split into training and testing and feed into maching learning alorithms the labeled training data and use the testing data to be able to predict the star ratings based on the reviews text.                     
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

| BCT Flooring and Showers          | During my recent visit to Las Vegas, I was looking for a decent place for milk tea in the Chinatown area. While their tea menu was quite extensive, I was unimpressed with the rose milk tea I ordered. It didn't have much flavor at all and was pretty watered down. This was my first time at Tea Station and I've always heard positive feedback of the location I have back home. The service was a bit slow and the place wasn't even crowded. Maybe I just need to stick to California or New York if I want decent milk tea in the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |     2 |

| Showtime Tours                    | Best shrimp ever... The food is great, not to say it's all been good, I have had to send back some mussels because they just didn't taste right but I've been going here for over 7 years, very tasty selections, the char grilled octopus in vinagrette dressing is lovely, the shrimp appetizer is heaven, I even get them to make it an entree sometimes... so tasty.  Other then that one time, the mussels in wine are usually very good.  The place is very homey and relaxed.  Definately an older crowd, probably locals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     4 |
| China Restaurant                  | Pretty good pizza.  Dined in and the pizza had a nice crispy crust, good amount of fresh toppings and tasted just fine.  They also have a great juke box.

| Neubert Painting                  | Was recommended by a co-worker years ago and I have been going ever since.  Solid inexpensive chinese food, nothing fancy but I don't think I have had a bad meal here.  I have tried many places in china town that we have read about on here and a lot are good but they really can't beat this palace, and considering the price it's our go to spot.  Way better than all those "whatever WOK" places that are in every strip mall all over the valley, at least all the ones I have tried.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     4 |

| Vegas Uncork'd: The Grand Tasting | What can I say about Mattie's.  It's a great Diner through and through.

|                                   |    I usually get The Junkyard with it's heaping plate of chili, potatoes and eggs cooked to order. I've also sampled the Chicken fried chicken and it was crispy and tender at the same time!  I have to recommend their French Toast with the Challah bread.  It's so soft and sweet, you'll wish all French Toast was like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |       |

| Arizona Goldendoodles             | It is what the name says it is. Cheap stuff and bad customer service. Went to buy headphones, and I was browsing through them when a sales associate recommended a pair of headphones. Assuming that they knows best, I purchased them, double checking with the cashier if I can return it, who said I can within 10 days. So, after trying them on I realized that the sound (even on low) was terrible, and also kept falling off my ear. So when I got the time, which was after 7 days, I went back to the store to return them and purchase another brand . But the manager , Nick Veras(not sure about spellings, that's what he said it was), without even checking if the product was defective,rudely and arrogantly insisted that he cannot take it back. He didn't even check it for defects. So, after horrible customer service, I lost 16$ on a pair of useless headphones which I may not even use. Their sales trick is to recommend bad products and AFTER purchasing and trying them out, and if it doesn't work, refuse to even give store credit. It's a scam. I am telling you. I wish I went to Futureshop or Bestbuy where you can actually be satisfied with your purchase. So folks, don't go here. Stay away and spend money on somewhere good. |     1 |
| Shafa Medical Clinic              | Attended a Wedding at this Chapel and was beyond impressed. The Chapel is located in THEhotel at Mandalay Bay which is incredibly classy and beautiful. The Chapel is gorgeously decorated and the perfect size for an intimate Vegas getaway Wedding. The rooms to get ready are nice and cozy with big mirrors, a bathroom and couch in each one. The Chapel itself is very nice and the picture taking area is cute. For a Vegas Wedding, I would suggest this Chapel to anyone planning their nuptials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     5 |

| Hardee's                          | I love the food here!!! usually get the Pollo Cubano which is delicious. I also like getting the Plantanes (look at the pictures, it's the one with the fried bananas) the bean dip is out of this world! i usually take my friends here to eat and they all seem to like it. this is also a nice place to take that special someone out on a lovely date. it's relaxing and the valet parking makes it seem like you're a million bucks. hahaha                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |     5 |
